# Project: Movie Recommender Using Machine Learning

![Workflow](demo/6.jpeg)

Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly essential in our busy lives, helping us make informed choices quickly. These systems use advanced algorithms to personalize content recommendations, saving us time and enhancing our experiences. By leveraging user data, recommendation systems predict and suggest items that align with our preferences and behaviors.

## About This Project

This project is a Streamlit web application that recommends movies based on user interests. 

## Dataset Used

## Model Concept: Cosine Similarity

1. Cosine Similarity measures the similarity between two vectors, resulting in a value between 0 and 1.
2. This metric is used to compare document vectors in this project.
3. A value of 0 indicates complete dissimilarity, while 1 indicates perfect similarity.
